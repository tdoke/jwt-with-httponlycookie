1] storing jwt in session or local storage.
   Never put sensitive information in session/local storage. Third pary javascript can access
   session/local storage very easily.
2] storing jwt in http only cookies
   This is better way of storing jwts as 
    2.1] httponly cookies cannot be accessed by browser javascript.
    2.2] by default httponly cookie will be sent along with each http request.
